# InventoryWizard
App to simplify inventory audits at work.
Written in C#.NET using WPF

## TODO:
* Support for all kinds of CSV's
* Room audit functionality (useful for CO-G18 and CO-G58)
* Dynamically updating search autofill on audit page
* Permanent storage for imported inventory file, until new one is imported.
* Direct HITS integration (maybe someday)
