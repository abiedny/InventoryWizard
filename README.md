# InventoryWizard
App to simplify inventory audits at work.
Written in C#.NET using WPF

## Recently Added:
* Search now autofills as you type in the service tag. Selecting an object in the list will now cause it to fill the service tag input box
* HITS inventory CSV file locations are now stored persistently as a setting. The default location is \HITS.csv, and it will be updated whenever the import inventory functionality is used

## TODO:
* Support for all kinds of CSV's
* Room audit functionality (useful for CO-G18 and CO-G58)
* Direct HITS integration (maybe someday)
